= Reactiverse Governance

_Version 1.0_

== Scope of the reactiverse

The _reactiverse_ community at https://reactiverse.io/[https://reactiverse.io/] and https://github.com/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse] is a collection of open source projects that gravitate around the _Eclipse Vert.x_ and _reactive (system, programming and stream)_ communities.
We expect most projects to have a strong relationship with Eclipse Vert.x, but we are open to other proposal from the _reactive_ ecosystem.

While independent from the https://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x] project, the _reactiverse_ gathers useful quality projects that may serve the community of developers relying on Eclipse Vert.x.
All _reactiverse_ projects share the Maven group identifier `io.reactiverse`.

An important consideration is that _reactiverse_ projects need to stay up-to-date with Eclipse Vert.x releases.
We expect projects to align with Eclipse Vert.x versions within a month of a new release.

The _reactiverse_ is not a legal entity.

The _reactiverse_ is a welcoming, inclusive and meritocratic community.
There is a process for proposing new projects, and the _reactiverse_ community will discuss proposals in an open and constructive manner.

The _reactiverse_ does not serve as an incubator for new modules to graduate to the Eclipse Vert.x project stack.
Similarly, it does not serve as a _attic_ for modules when they are deprecated from the Eclipse Vert.x stack.
That being said, mobility between Eclipse Vert.x and the _reactiverse_ may occasionally happen.

== Roles

The _reactiverse_ community governance recognizes the following roles.

=== Initial contributors

An _initial contributor_ is an individual that proposes a new project to the _reactiverse_.
A project may be proposed by several initial contributors.

Because the _reactiverse_ is not a legal entity, organisations that intend to propose projects to the _reactiverse_ need to identify qualified individuals and give them complete permissions to make proposals.

=== Contributors

A _contributor_ is someone who reports issues and/or offers contributions to a _reactiverse_ project.

A contributor must abide to the https://developercertificate.org/[developer certificate of origin].

A contributor does not have commit access to a _reactiverse_ project repository.

=== Maintainers

A _maintainer_ is a person who is responsible for managing a _reactiverse_ project.
This includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that issue reports, contributions, and releases are being handled.
A project can have several maintainers.

Maintainers have commit and administrative permissions over their _reactiverse_ repositories.
A maintainer of a _reactiverse_ project is not automatically a maintainer in another _reactiverse_ project.

Maintainers have the permission to publish artifacts to Maven central and other public repositories under the `io.reactiverse` group identifier.

An initial contributor automatically becomes a maintainer when a project proposal has been accepted.

A contributor can be proposed to become a maintainer by existing maintainers, and a public vote among reactiverse-wide maintainers is being triggered.

A maintainer may freely elect to step down as a maintainer of part or all projects.
In this case a maintainer becomes _emeritus_, and the remaining maintainers elect new maintainers for the impacted projects if they happen to have no maintainer anymore.

When a maintainer has not responded to sollicitations within 6 months, the other _reactiverse_ maintainers may trigger a vote to elect new maintainers on the maintainer projects.
After 1 year without response to sollicitations and no public willingness to step down, a maintainer can be moved to an _emeritus_ status by any other _reactiverse_ maintainer, without a vote being necessary.

== Projects

=== Licensing

Projects must be made available under one or a conjunction of the following open source licenses:

* Apache Software License v2.0
* Eclipse Public License v2.0
* Mozilla Public License v2.0
* MIT
* BSD

=== Operations

Maintainers discuss incoming issues and contributions via GitHub issues and pull-requests.
Maintainers have the right to decline a contribution, be it because it does not match the project scope or because it does not satisfy quality requirements.
In any case constructive feedback will be given.

We ask all code contributions to abide to the https://developercertificate.org/[developer certificate of origin].
Git commits may optionally be signed-off.

=== Releases

Version numbers and schemes are at the discretion of each project maintainer(s).

Maintainers can publish new versions whenever they want.

When a new version of Eclipse Vert.x is being published, projects must ensure compliance within a month of the latest Eclipse Vert.x release.
Projects may elect to support several Eclipse Vert.x versions and not just the latest.

We understand that maintainer availability can fluctuate depending on personal and professional constraints, hence maintainers from other projects have the permission to commit and release new versions of a project when it fails to align with Eclipse Vert.x releases within a month.
This is to ensure that all _reactiverse_ projects remain relevant.

== Open decision process

No part of the decision process must happen behind closed doors.

All discussions will happen using GitHub issues at https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse] 

=== Voting

Votes happen on GitHub issues, and _reactiverse_ maintainers can vote in comments:

* +1 means _“I fully agree”_
* 0 means _“I won’t get in the way, but I am not in favour”_
* -1 means _“I full disagree, here is a veto”_.

Votes run for 72 hours.

Votes require a 50% quorum from the reactiverse-maintainers.

A _“-1”_ vote is a _veto_ that fails the vote.
A veto must always be accompanied by a factual justification, or it is considered void.
A veto can be retracted, in which case a new vote can be triggered.

=== Project proposal

Proposals must be sent as issues to https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse]. 
While there is no formal template, we expect the following content:

* Project name
* Project goal
* Licensing
* Motivation to the join the _reactiverse_
* Existing implementation

By proposing projects, _initial contributors_ implicitly consent to this governance model.

Each proposal will be evaluated by other _reactiverse_ maintainers, and all discussions happen on the proposal GitHub issue.
At some point in time a _reactiverse_ maintainer triggers a vote to accept or reject the proposal.

=== Votes on roles

Except when an initial contributor becomes a maintainer because a project proposal has been accepted, all role updates that need a vote must have a corresponding issue at https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse].

The issue will be used for votes, but also for discussions.

=== Administration of the GitHub organization and related assets

The `reactiverse` organization on GitHub needs owners who can perform various administration duties, including transferring repositories, authorizing third-party services access, and more.
This also includes the associated domain names.

The `Maintainers` file lists who among the maintainers have such permissions.

The usual voting process and rules apply for administration, including but not limited to:

* obtaining administration permissions,
* requesting a repository transfer,
* allowing a third-party service access.

=== Revisions

This governance document can be reviewed and revised by the _reactiverse_ maintainers from time to time.

Evolutions can be proposed using GitHub issues and pull-requests on the governance document at https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse/reactiverse].
Evolutions are being ratified through the voting rules above.
Upon success, this governance document is being updated and the new version becomes the current one.
