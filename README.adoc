= The Reactiverse

The _reactiverse_ community at https://reactiverse.io/[https://reactiverse.io/] and https://github.com/reactiverse[https://github.com/reactiverse] is a collection of open source projects that gravitate around the _Eclipse Vert.x_ and _reactive (system, programming and stream)_ communities.

We expect most projects to have a strong relationship with https://vertx.io/[Eclipse Vert.x], but we are open to other proposal from the _reactive_ ecosystem.
